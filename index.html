				<strong>Nelson Mandela</strong> was the first black president of
				South Africa, elected after being in prison for 27 years he got
				the Novel Peace Prize in 1993 for the effort to dismantle the
				country's aparheid system. <br />

				Mandela was born on 1918 in a small village of Mvezo in
				Transkei, South Africa with the birth name of Rolihlahla
				Mandela. <br />

				When he was 12 years old his father died of lung disease, and he
				was adopted by Chied Jongintaba, gesture done as a favor to
				Mandela's father, causing his life to change dramatically.
				<br />

				During a period he developed an interest in African history from
				elder chiefs from who learned how the African people had lived
				in relative peace until the coming of the white people. <br />

				In 1961, Mandela was arrested for leading a three-day national
				workers' strike and was sentenced to five years in prison. Two
				years later he was brought to trial again, and this time, he and
				other 10 ANC leaders were sentenced to life imprisionment for
				political offenses, including sabotage. <br />

				During his 27 years in prison he was able to earn a Bachelor of
				Law degree through a University of London and internationally,
				he continued to be such a potent symbol of black resistance. In
				1990 with increasing local and international pressure for his
				release, the goverment participaed in several talks with Mandela
				but not deal was made. And it wasn't until Botha suffered a
				stroke and was replaced by Frederik Willem de Klerk that
				Mandela's release was finally announced. <br />

				In 1991, Mandela was elected president of the African National
				Congress, and in 1993 Mandela and President de klerk were
				jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Price for their work toward
				dismantling apartheid in South Africa. <br />
